This project is a simple cli client for various fun/random APIs. It's built using python's requests and click packages for generating API calls and a CLI, respectively.

To use, ensure you have requests and click installed somewhere and place the covfefe.py file somewhere in your PATH. Make it executable, and ideally rename it to remove the .py extension. I've placed a shebang line at the top of the file so it should run in your default system python interpreter for python3.
